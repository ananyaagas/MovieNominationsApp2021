# Shopify 2021 Front-End Internship
This project was developed for the UX Developer Intern & Web Developer Intern Challenge - Summer 2021

## The UX Developer Intern & Web Developer Intern Challenge - Summer 2021:
A webpage that can search the website OMDB for movies and display the results, allow the user to add a movie from the search results to a nomination list, view the list of films already nominated, and remove a nominee from the nomination list.

### Technical Requirements:
- Search results should come from OMDB's API (free API key: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).
- Each search result should list at least its title, year of release and a button to nominate that film.
- Updates to the search terms should update the result list
- Movies in search results can be added and removed from the nomination list.
- If a search result has already been nominated, disable its nominate button.
- Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations.
